Added TIME attribute to ORDERS table to capture date/time order was created.

Changed ORDNUM(int) to ORDID(CHAR 13) on ORDERS and ORDERITEMS table. This was necessary to use a PHP uniqueid in order to 
insert ORDERS and ORDERITEMS in the same transaction when saving customer orders.

Recreated Foreign Keys with ON DELETE RESTRICT, but DBMS still allows deletion of parent records when child exists.

Delivery is assumed for now. Delivery flag display/edit will be implemented at a later date.

Coupon display/edit removed for now.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
2012-12-11 
Changed header.php menu to get categories from database and have a dynamic drop-down for categories under menu. Each item on the drop-down
calls menu.php?cat=000000, where 000000 is the category id. 

Next, need to modify menu.php to use the $cat to load items into menu page.

After that, add php  to load selections into cart.

The order will be $_SESSION 2D array that that has two columns, PRODID and QTY.

Hi Matt,
I'm not quite finished with the product input/edit, but it is almost, very nearly, just about finished. I modified header.php to show Admin and Owner menus if the logged in user is an admin and/or owner.

I input all the product categories, but the products themselves remain. I put a searchable pdf of the menu in dev/resources, so if you want to and have the time, you can start inputting the products. The Product admin page still has a lot of debug info showing but it mostly works, so you can use that if you want.The product edit has some problems  - it changes the product category for one, so be careful if you use it. You can also do input or import from a CSV file on myPhpadmin on cPanel.

I also edited the drinks.php, but I think that in order to achieve data independence, we'll need to make a generic product/menu page in case categories are renamed (drinks -> beverages) or deleted, or added.

I think we have a very good foundation on which to build the shopping cart, so we are almost there!

Let me know what you think and what you've been working on. I'm working 3 - midnight. I'm not sure if I'll be able to work on it after work tonight.
Kevin
