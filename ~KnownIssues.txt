BUG: 12/16/12  If you edit your account, even if you dont actually edit anything, clicking the "Save Changes" button causes the PWHash
			   to be deleted (you can see this by refreshing the USER page in PhPMyAdmin). The account is still there, but you can no
			   longer log into that account.  This currently happens in /matt and /dev because they are using the same code, just different
			   layouts.
			   
			   FIXED ** editaAccount.php was updating USERS.PWHASH to blank, when that field should only be updated during password change, which
			   isn't implemented yet. Fixed bug by removing USERS.PWHASH from update query.
